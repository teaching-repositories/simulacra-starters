# Simulacra Starter Notebooks

You have three possible starter notebooks to choose from: the [Product Popularity Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/product_popularity_simulation_starter.ipynb), the [Stock Market Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/stock_market_simulation_starter.ipynb), and the [Resource Fluctuations Simulator](https://github.com/teaching-repositories/simulacra-starters/blob/main/resource_flucuations_simulation_starter.ipynb). Below is a general overview of how to utilize these notebooks effectively:

## Getting Started

1. **Select Your Simulation**: Choose the notebook corresponding to the simulation you want to explore: Product Popularity, Stock Market, or Resource Fluctuations.

2. **Run the Simulation**: Each notebook contains classes or functions to run the simulation. Follow the instructions provided to generate simulated data and explore various scenarios.

3. **Visualize the Results**: Utilize the plotting functions within each notebook to graph and analyze the simulated data. These visualizations help you understand trends and patterns in the simulated scenarios.

## Objectives

- Analyze different aspects of the chosen simulation, such as consumer behavior, market trends, or resource management.
- Develop skills in data analysis and interpretation within specific domains.
- Enhance your programming proficiency, especially in utilizing Python libraries for simulation and visualization.

## Using Google Colab

These notebooks are designed to be run on Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for executing Python code. You can work on these notebooks without any specific setups on your local machine. Remember to save a copy of the notebook in your GitHub repository to preserve your work and data.

## Preparation

Familiarize yourself with the notebook's user interface and features, especially if you're new to Google Colab. Review the provided code snippets and accompanying explanatory texts within the notebook to understand how the simulation and plotting functions work.
